Several health conditions, your lifestyle, and your age and family history can increase your risk for heart disease. These are called risk factors. About half of all Americans (47%) have at least 1 of 3 key risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. Some risk factors for heart disease cannot be controlled, such as your age or family history. But you can take steps to lower your risk by changing the factors you can control.

The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts.

The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patients' information. It includes over 3,000 records and 15 attributes. Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioral, and medical risk factors.
